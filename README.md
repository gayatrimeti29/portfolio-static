# Gayatri Meti — Portfolio (static)

This is a simple static portfolio site built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local setup
1. Clone the repo or download files.
2. Make sure the folder structure is:
   - index.html
   - css/style.css
   - js/main.js
   - assets/profile.jpg (optional)
   - assets/resume.pdf (put your resume here)

## Customize
- Edit `js/main.js` CONFIG object to change name, tagline, bio, githubUsername and formspreeEndpoint.
- Replace `assets/profile.jpg` with your photo.
- Replace `assets/resume.pdf` with your resume PDF.

## Deploy
Push the repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages on branch `main` (root).

## Notes
- Contact form uses Formspree. Create a form at https://formspree.io then replace the endpoint in `js/main.js`.
